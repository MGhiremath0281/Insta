# InstaFraud Detection Project â€“ Explanation to Guide

## 1. Problem Statement
Today, many fake or bot accounts are active on Instagram. They can spread misinformation, promote scams, or give fake likes and followers.  
This is a real issue for brands, influencers, and regular users who rely on authentic engagement.

My project detects whether an Instagram account is **fake or real** based on its profile data.  
It checks metrics like number of followers, posts, followings, and other behavioral patterns to predict if the account is suspicious.

## 3. Tools & Skills Used
- **Python** for data processing and model building  
- **Streamlit** to create a user-friendly web interface  
- **Machine Learning** to classify accounts as fake or genuine

## 4. Real-World Use Case
This tool can help:

- **Users** detect fake followers or suspicious accounts

## 5. Learning Outcome
Through this project, I learned:
- How to build and train a real-world ML model
